<h2>About Astro</h2>
Astro is designed for fast-paced and efficient code writing, thus being guaranteed by simplicity and easy-to-learn syntax.
<br>
The back-end is, as already said, based on Python and C++. 
<br>
The compiler is written in Python and the bytecode interpreter is written in C++.
<br>
<br>
We designed the bytecode interpreter in C++ because of expected speed of execution time and the compiler in Python because speed is, while still important, not the most important aspect in compilation. Once a program is compiled it can always be executed in fast manner without much time being lost.
